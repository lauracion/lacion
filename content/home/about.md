# Greetings, stranger.

I am a Biostatistician transitioning to Data Science. I specialize in some areas of Health Sciences. I am passionate about changing the way applied stats is taught and practiced. 

I have so much to learn and do that it seems I will be needing some extra lives to accomplish all. In the meantime, I also mother two adorable sons in [Buenos Aires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires).

A complete version of my sleep-inducing academic CV [here](/files/Acion_CV_November_2018_web_long.pdf). A shorter version [here](/files/Acion_CV_November_2018_web_short.pdf). Still rather long for non-academic standards, a more friendly post about me and what I am up to [here](/post/about-me-and-current-projects).
