# Greetings, stranger.

I am a Biostatistician transitioning to Data Science. I specialize in several areas of Health Sciences. I am passionate about changing the way applied stats is taught and practiced. 

I have so much to learn and to do that it seems I will be needing some extra lives to accomplish all. In the meantime, I also mother two adorable sons in [Buenos Aires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires).

A complete version of my academic CV is [here](/files/Acion_CV_November_2018_web_long.pdf). A shorter version can be found [here](/files/Acion_CV_November_2018_web_short.pdf) (still rather long by non-academic standards). A more friendly post about me and what I am up to is [here](/post/about-me-and-current-projects). I am still in the process of uploading all my work to this site. 

I am putting together my research group; if you are interested in anything that I do, I would be happy to hear from you. If in doubt, please reach out.
