My latest news is that I am an Adjunct Research Scientist at the [National Research Council in Argentina (CONICET)](https://www.conicet.gov.ar/?lan=en). I work at the [Instituto de Calculo, FCEN, UBA](http://www.ic.fcen.uba.ar/en/) where I lead a data science research group focusing on the extraction of knowledge from electronic medical records. My goal in this part of my career is to switch from paid-walled science to open science.

Teaching is another passion of mine. Most of my teaching has been for graduate courses in introductory applied statistics for a health science audience. I recently became an instructor and a trainer for [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) and taught my first Carpentries' course.

I am active in the academic publishing world, where I am the creator and Associate Editor of [AJDAA's Methods for Addiction Research Section](http://explore.tandfonline.com/cfp/med/american-journal-of-drug-and-alcohol-abuse-methods-in-addiction-research). Other ways I collaborate in research are by being a member of the Data Safety Monitoring Board at [NIMH](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/index.shtml) and an ad-hoc reviewer for [RRD&D at the VA](https://www.research.va.gov/services/rrd.cfm).

The open source community helped me endlessly throughout my career. My way to give back to it is by helping the R community grow in Latin America. I started by co-founding [R-Ladies Buenos Aires](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-buenos-aires/) and I am now part of the [R-Ladies Global Leaderhsip Team](https://rladies.org/about-us/team/). I also co-created and chair [LatinR <- Latin American Conference for the Use of R in Research + Development](http://latin-r.com/en) and co-founded [R en Baires](https://renbaires.github.io/), a Buenos Aires R user group.  

I try to be involved and help as much as possible in any project that adds transparency and openness to research. I am passionate about ways to improve data analysis teaching, too. One of the roles I enjoy most is to help and mentor others. My passions are potentiated when they can flourish in Latin America.

If you are interested in any of this, I will be happy to hear from and/or work with you. If in doubt, please reach out.
