Go to this post if you want to know what I am up to these days.

My latest news is that I am starting as an Adjunct Research Scientist at the [National Research Council in Argentina (CONICET)](https://www.conicet.gov.ar/?lan=en). I will work at the [Instituto de Calculo, FCEN, UBA (IC)](http://www.ic.fcen.uba.ar/en/) where I will lead a data science research group focusing on the extraction of actionable knowledge from electronic medical records. 
I have over 15 years of experience in clinical research, mostly on addiction and psychiatry through collaboration with different research groups in the US, where I am an Associate Research Scientist at the Department of Psychiatry (College of Medicine, University of Iowa).

I also recently became a senior consultant for the Data Science Program at Fundacion Sadosky. My job there is to help linking Data Science talents both in academia and industry in Argentina and showcasing and further develop Data Science in my country.

I am also an Associate Professor at the Instituto Universitario del Hospital Italiano and an Invited Professor at IC. Most of my teaching is for graduate courses in introductory applied statistics for a health science audience. In addition, I am preparing a course for Datacamp about Longitudinal Data Analysis with R.

Some time ago I became more active in the academic publication world where I am the Associate Editor of the Methods Section for Addiction Research of AJDAA. Other ways I collaborate in research are by being a member of the Data Safety Monitoring Board at NIMH and an ad-hoc reviewer for RRD&D at the VA.

My way to give back to the open source community that helped me endlessly throughout my career has been to become one of the founders and organiziers of R-Ladies Buenos Aires and the New Chapters Liaison for R-Ladies Global. I am also one of the Chairs of LatinR <- Latin American Conference for the Use of R in Research + Development. I try to be involved and help as much as possible in any project that helps adding transparency and openness to research in this part of the world.
