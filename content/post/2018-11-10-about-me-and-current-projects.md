It has been over a year that I am an Adjunct Research Scientist at the [National Research Council in Argentina (CONICET)](https://www.conicet.gov.ar/?lan=en). I work at the [Instituto de Calculo, FCEN, UBA](http://www.ic.fcen.uba.ar/en/) where I lead a data science research group that is currently working in projects that include generation of natural language processing for writting medical reports from medical images, assessment of automatized machine learning performance, extraction of knowledge from electronic medical records, and other several other topics related to addiction. My goal in this part of my career is to switch from paid-walled science to open science.

Teaching is another passion of mine. Most of my teaching has been for graduate courses in introductory applied statistics for a health science audience. In 2018 and 2019, I became an instructor and a trainer for [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), respectively. In the wake of Covid19 and all classes having to switch to online format in Argentina, on March 16th I co-founded [MetaDocencia](https://metadocencia.org/en/), a volunteer-lead organization and community inspired in The Carpentries. Through MetaDocencia we are teaching to teach online using evidence-based techniques in Spanish.

I am active in the academic publishing world, where I am the founding Associate Editor of [AJDAA's Methods for Addiction Research Section](http://explore.tandfonline.com/cfp/med/american-journal-of-drug-and-alcohol-abuse-methods-in-addiction-research). Other ways I collaborate in research are by being a member of the Data Safety Monitoring Board at [NIMH](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/index.shtml) and an ad-hoc reviewer for [RRD&D at the VA](https://www.research.va.gov/services/rrd.cfm).

The open source community helped me endlessly throughout my career. My way to give back to it is by helping the R community grow in Latin America. I started by co-founding [R-Ladies Buenos Aires](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-buenos-aires/) and I am now part of the [R-Ladies Global Leaderhsip Team](https://rladies.org/about-us/team/). I also co-founded and was the first LatinR edition's local chair [LatinR <- Latin American Conference for the Use of R in Research + Development](http://latin-r.com/en) and co-founded [R en Baires](https://renbaires.github.io/), a Buenos Aires R user group.

I try to be involved and help as much as possible in any project that adds transparency and openness to research. I am passionate about ways to improve data analysis teaching, too. One of the roles I enjoy most is to help and mentor others. My passions are potentiated when they can flourish in Latin America.

If you are interested in any of this, I will be happy to hear from and/or work with you. If in doubt, please reach out.
