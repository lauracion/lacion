Yesterday I realized that it has been almost a year I don't add to this website a blog post. That is because all my blogging energy has been contributed to blogs co-written with others in communities of practice I help lead.

I am quite privileged to not have a chance to be a solo author anymore and write together with such amazing co-authors to showcase everyone's work. Here follows only a few examples, some in English, some in Spanish, and some in both languages. English is a barrier for most people in the world and I want the communities where I put my volunteer time to aim at leaving nobody behind. Still a lot to do to achieve my goal, but I keep working hard everyday towards it.

Here are some of the posts I co-authored in this apparent blog posting hiatus from most recent to oldest:

* [Our first month teaching to teach](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/post/cumple_mes/)

* [Nuestro primer mes ensenando a ensenar](https://www.metadocencia.org/post/cumple_mes/)

* [Como colaborar con MetaDocencia](https://www.metadocencia.org/post/como-colaborar/)

* [Personas tipo para nuestros cursos de ABC](https://www.metadocencia.org/post/personas-tipo/)

* [Ensenando online con poca anticipacion](https://www.metadocencia.org/post/gwilson-webinar/)

* [Recipe for a year-end video](https://yabellini.netlify.app/post/videorladies2019/)

* [R-Ladies Global's response to the DataCamp Assessment Report](https://blog.rladies.org/post/datacamp-third-party-review/)
