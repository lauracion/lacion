Here goes my attempt for a narrated, and hopefully, more appealing version of how I became up to this point in my career. It's a long story that takes two posts.

I am a biostatistician in my way to becoming a data scientist (more on why I don´t consider quite yet myself a data scientist in a future post or you can [watch Jenny Bryan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIeCuzfHQ6A&feature=youtu.be) explaining it better than I will ever do). 

How did I get there? I started working in research as soon as I decided I was going to pursue a Licenciate in Biology [here](https://exactas.uba.ar/). I needed to know if I was going to like being a biologist asap.

After a year at the bench of [this lab](http://www.leloir.org.ar/quesadaallue/), I knew that lab work was not my thing (I will always be grateful to the PIs there who opened a spot in that lab to a 18-yo Laura who knew nothing). At that point (circa '96), I started to be curious about mixing biology with other disciplines. I started learning Unix and approved all the requirements to become a computer scientist [here](https://www.dc.uba.ar/). For Summer '97, I was accepted to a Cours Pasteur d'Informatique en Biologie (the "Argentine" [here](https://www.laurentbloch.net/MySpip3/Enseigner-l-informatique-aux-biologistes) c'est moi :-D ) in OMG Paris. 

The course was wonderful, three full-time months learning in French to program mostly in Scheme and, of course, 1997-cutting-edge Bioinformatics. I discovered Bioinformatics was not my cup of tea either.

Then life took me off my academic path for the first time due to dad's health. 

'98: loving to go back to my studies, took both biology and computer science (CS) courses while working part-time as helpdesk for some $. '99: I was hired [here](https://www.fleni.org.ar/) for my first clinical research assistanship job. It was in human neuroimaging. I fell instantly in love with clinical research. I was finally able to explain to anyone interested, my job consisted in helping to figure out what changed in brains when you have Alzheimer's! This first job took me twice to Iowa City to learn more about neuroimaging.

After completing the first year of the licenciate in CS and having found my research love, I decided to quit CS and finish my undergrad Biology degree asap. Undergrad courses unrelated to my research were completely in the way of my dream job. I was losing my time in boring classes, just to get the right paperwork to be able to continue. Quite frustrating. That is how I must be one of the few biologists in my program to have graduated with the final exam of Calculus for Math. I am not the kind of person who enjoys unapplied Math. But it was very handy down the road. Keep reading.

I never was a 100% biologist. Fortunately, Steve Arndt saw that in me during my sencond trip to Iowa City to learn more neuroimaging. By 2001 I was accepted to the Biostats MS [here](https://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/biostat/). Steve mentored me into the program and still mentors me. Most of who I am professionaly I owe to Steve's mentorship.

But I doubted and did not go to study to the States. Growing up, Iowa City was a place I never saw in my future. By 2002, with one of the biggest economical crashes in Argentina (where I am from and live today), there was no doubt that Iowa City was an awesome place to go. Particularly when I could only afford a one-way ticket out of my beloved Buenos Aires.

While I furthered (my undergrad biometry and maths were very decent) my biostats education in Iowa, [this department of Psychiatry](https://medicine.uiowa.edu/psychiatry/), after Steve recommendation, employed me as a research assistant. Until getting my MS in Biostats, I worked there analyzing brain images. As soon as I got my MS in Biostats, my great mentor taught me to become a biostats consultant, and the art of writing and reviewing papers. He taught me by doing something I loved - most effective teaching ever!

Steve also conviced me to continue into the Biostats PhD program. By 2004, I was finally in love with Iowa City and also met my awesome life partner. He devotedly commuted every other month from Buenos Aires and stayed in Iowa City for a month.

By November 2005, life stroke again and got me back to Buenos Aires within 24hs from a phone call. Due to a mom's massive stroke, by December 2005 I had sold all my belongings in Iowa City, passed all exams for my last PhD courses, and was back in Buenos Aires for good. Thank you again, Steve, for shipping my books from the North so I could prep finals while taking care of mom. 

Thanks to the amazing support of everyone at the University of Iowa, good internet connection and about 20 short commutes from Buenos Aires, I was able to keep working remotely for Psychiatry (until today) and finishing my MPH (2006) and my PhD (not until 2011).

In the meantime (starting at about 2004), Steve showed me that there were some awesome public addiction large datasets that could be scientifically questioned and some valuable answers could be answered. This is how I started to like data science and how I started seeing myself becoming a PI. Until then, I always saw myself as a helper in the scientific process, where original ideas belonged to others. It turned out, I could have my own research ideas.

By 2011 with almost a decade of clinical research of experience (5 of which were as the biostatistician of several projects), the desire of becoming my own PI was grew strong. But making a living out of science in Argentina has never been easy.
