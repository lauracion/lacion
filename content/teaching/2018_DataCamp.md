Mini class in English. With this mini class I became an instructor at DataCamp. I present an introduction on how to make inference by eye. That is, if you have a plot featuring one or two confidence intervals, how can you approximate a p-value just by looking at the plot.

PS: I worked for several months developping a course for longitudinal data analysis with R for DataCamp. For matters unrelated to course duties, I decided to stop my association with DataCamp before any of this work was finished.
